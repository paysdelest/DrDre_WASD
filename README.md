 # DrDre_WASD v2.1

> **Based on [HallJoy by PashOK7](https://github.com/PashOK7/HallJoy)** — significantly extended with a complete custom macro system, analog keyboard stability fixes, advanced gaming features, and a live mouse layout display.

DrDre_WASD is a Windows application that turns a **Hall-effect analog keyboard** into one or more virtual Xbox 360 controllers — with an advanced custom macro system on top.

It reads per-key analog values via the Wooting Analog SDK and publishes XInput-compatible controllers via ViGEmBus.

## 🆕 What's New in v2.2

- ✅ **Mouse Button Actions** — macros can now send mouse clicks (Left, Right, Middle, X1, X2) as action steps, with a live capture button 🖱 directly in the action panel
- ✅ **Live Mouse Layout** — a floating top-view mouse silhouette is permanently displayed in the top-right corner of the interface, above the tabs, showing real-time button press state (L, R, M, X1, X2) — mirrors the keyboard layout display
- ✅ **Scrollable Custom Macro tab** — the right column now fully scrolls with mouse wheel and a draggable scrollbar, so all controls remain accessible even on small screens
- ✅ **Action type dropdown fixed** — the action type combobox now properly opens as a full 6-item dropdown on click, without requiring mouse wheel scrolling to change the selection
- ✅ **Custom Macros tab** — free-trigger macro system with keyboard/mouse triggers, N-times repeat, cancel-on-release, drag & drop reorder
- ✅ **comfort**  action deletion directly via the interface using a [X] button
- ✅ **Trigger preview** — display the trigger as small gray text below each macro in the list without having to select it


---

## 🆕 What's New in v2.0

- ✅ **Custom Macro Tab** — free-trigger macro editor replacing the old Combo/Macro tab, fully redesigned with a premium dark UI
- ✅ **Enable / Disable Macros** — toggle any macro via the UI checkbox or right-click on the list, without deleting it
- ✅ **Mouse Combo Triggers** — right-click held + left click, middle-click combos, scroll wheel combos, double-clicks, simultaneous clicks
- ✅ **Emergency Stop** — `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F12` instantly halts all running macros
- ✅ **abiv1.dll deadlock fix** — resolved a crash after ~4 hours of runtime caused by a mutex deadlock in `unload()` inside the universal-analog-plugin
- ✅ **Thread-safe analog backend** — Wooting analog reads protected by mutex, atomic state management
- ✅ **Improved shutdown sequence** — proper hook cleanup on exit to prevent crashes

## ⌨️ Keyboard Support

DrDre_WASD uses:
- [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk)
- [Universal Analog Plugin](https://github.com/AnalogSense/universal-analog-plugin)

This means it works with many HE keyboards supported by this stack — not just Wooting.

**Aula keyboards**: Experimental support is available but limited. Proper native support would require firmware-level changes or direct help from Aula firmware developers.

---

## 📦 DLL Installation — REQUIRED

The repository includes prebuilt `abiv0.dll` and `abiv1.dll` from the universal-analog-plugin, **with the deadlock fix applied** (stable 24h+ runtime).

⚠️ **You MUST place the DLL files in this exact folder:** `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\`

Create the folder if it does not exist. Without this step, the analog keyboard will not be detected.

| File | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| `abiv0.dll` | `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\abiv0.dll` |
| `abiv1.dll` | `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\abiv1.dll` |

> 💡 If you prefer to compile the DLL yourself, the source is at [universal-analog-plugin](https://github.com/calamity-inc/universal-analog-plugin). Apply the `unload()` fix described in the Technical Details section below.

⚠️ **If you get a Get-WinEvent error mentioning:** `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\universal-analog-plugin\abiv1.dll`
> Also copy the `.dll` to: `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\universal-analog-plugin\abiv1.dll`
> Or create both paths: `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\abiv1.dll` **and** `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\universal-analog-plugin\abiv1.dll`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Copy `abiv0.dll` and `abiv1.dll` to `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\`
2. Install [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus)
3. Install [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk)
4. Launch `DrDre_WASD.exe`
5. Select or create a keyboard layout
6. Map keys to controller inputs in the **Remap** tab
7. Adjust curves and behaviors in **Configuration**
8. Create and manage macros in the **Custom Macro** tab

> If dependencies are missing, the application may offer to download/install them automatically.

## 🖱️ Live Mouse Layout

A **floating mouse silhouette** is permanently displayed in the **top-right corner** of the main window, above the tab bar — always visible regardless of which tab is active, just like the keyboard layout.

- Drawn as a **top-view mouse shape** using smooth Bézier curves — no placeholder icons
- **L** (left button), **R** (right button), **M** (wheel click), **X1** and **X2** (thumb side buttons) are individually displayed
- Each button **lights up in blue** when physically pressed, returns to dark when released
- Refreshes at **60 fps** — zero perceptible lag on the display
- No border, no label, no card — the silhouette floats directly on the background, exactly like the keyboard layout

This makes it easy to visually confirm which mouse button a trigger or action is mapped to, and to verify live captures in real time.

## 🎬 Custom Macro Tab — Complete Guide

The **Custom Macro** tab lets you bind complex action sequences to any **mouse button or keyboard trigger combination**, fired automatically during gameplay — no dedicated macro keys needed.

### Creating a Macro

1. Click **`+ New`** to create a new macro entry
2. Give it a name in the **Combo Name** field
3. Click **`● Capture trigger`** — press your desired key or mouse button combination (1 or 2 inputs)
4. Build your action sequence in the **Actions** card
5. Click **`💾 Save combo`** to confirm

### Enable / Disable a Macro

- **Check the box** `Combo enabled` in the Options card, then Save — or
- **Right-click** the macro in the list for an instant toggle

The left list shows a **green dot** (active) or **grey dot** (inactive) next to each macro for a quick overview.

### Available Trigger Types

#### Mouse triggers
| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Right-click held + Left click | ADS + fire (most common gaming combo) |
| Left-click held + Right click | Alternate ADS combo |
| Middle-click held + Left click | Custom utility |
| Middle-click held + Right click | Custom utility |
| Double left-click | Fast double-tap action |
| Double right-click | Fast double-tap action |
| Left + right click simultaneously | Two-button safety combo |
| Scroll up + right-click held | Scope cycle while aiming |
| Scroll down + right-click held | Cancel reload / weapon swap |

#### Keyboard triggers
Any single key or modifier + key combination captured via the **Capture trigger** button.

### Action Types

Each macro is a sequence of steps — mix and match freely:

| Action | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Press key | 🔵 | Holds a key down until a Release action |
| Release key | ⚫ | Releases a previously held key |
| Tap key | 🟢 | Instant press + release |
| Type text | 🟡 | Types a full string of characters |
| Mouse click | 🟣 | Left, Right, Middle, X1 or X2 click |
| Wait (ms) | ⬜ | Pause between actions |

#### 🖱️ Mouse Click Actions — Live Capture

When **Mouse click** is selected as the action type, a **🖱 capture button** appears to the right of the value field. Click it, then press any mouse button — the button name fills in automatically.

Supported buttons: `left`, `right`, `middle`, `X1 (thumb)`, `X2 (thumb2)`

You can also type the button name directly in the value field without using the capture button.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Combo enabled | Enable or disable the macro without deleting it |
| Repeat while held | Keeps firing the sequence while the trigger is held |
| Repeat delay | Milliseconds between each repetition |

### Interface Notes

- The right column **scrolls** with the mouse wheel when the window is too small vertically — a thin accent-colored scrollbar appears on the right edge and can be dragged
- The action type **dropdown opens fully** on click, showing all 6 action types at once

## 🏗️ DrDre_WASD Input Architecture

DrDre_WASD processes input through three distinct pipelines:

- **Analog → Controller**
- **Analog → Macro → Controller**
- **Analog → Macro → Direct Game (Keyboard Injection)**

## 🔧 Building

1. Open `HallJoy.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Select `Release | x64`
3. Build — the PreBuildEvent automatically copies `wooting_analog_sdk.dll` and `wooting_analog_wrapper.dll` from `runtime\` to the output directory

> ⚠️ **Note**: `wooting_analog_sdk.dll` and `wooting_analog_wrapper.dll` are included in the `runtime\` folder of this repository and bundled in the source zip. If downloading v1.0, get them from the [runtime folder](https://github.com/paysdelest/DrDre_WASD/tree/main/runtime) or from [Wooting Analog SDK releases](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk/releases) and place them in `runtime\` before building.

> ⚠️ **Note for developers**: `free_combo_system.cpp` and `free_combo_ui.cpp` must be explicitly added to the Visual Studio project (right-click project → **Add → Existing Item**). They are not referenced in the `.vcxproj` by default.

## 🔩 Technical Details — abiv1.dll Deadlock Fix

A critical bug was identified and fixed in the **universal-analog-plugin** (`abiv1.dll`). After ~4 hours of runtime, the plugin crashed with `0xc0000005 INVALID_POINTER_READ` inside `unload()`.

**Root cause**: `awaitCompletion()` was called while `devices_mtx` was still held. The internal device thread then called `discover_devices()`, which also tries to acquire `devices_mtx` — deadlock. Windows force-terminated the thread, corrupting internal pointers.

**Fix**: split `unload()` into two passes — `cancelReceiveReport()` with the lock held, then `awaitCompletion()` after releasing the lock. The fixed DLL runs stably for 12h+.

A fix has been submitted upstream to [universal-analog-plugin](https://github.com/calamity-inc/universal-analog-plugin).

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **All analog values at 0** — check your keyboard's firmware mode. Some keyboards disable analog SDK output when **Turbo mode** is enabled. Disable it and restart.
- **Analog stops working after a plugin update** — reinstall the DLL files from this repository and keep only one plugin variant in `C:\Program Files\WootingAnalogPlugins\`
- **Macro does not trigger** — check whether the emergency stop was activated (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F12`), or verify the macro is enabled (green dot in the list)
- **Macro enabled but not firing** — make sure the trigger combination is not captured by another application or system shortcut
- **Controls do not resize correctly** — make sure you are using v2.0 or later; previous builds had a WM_SIZE layout bug when the tab was hidden
- **Mouse action not firing** — verify the button name is spelled exactly: `left`, `right`, `middle`, `X1 (thumb)`, or `X2 (thumb2)`
- **Mouse view not visible** — the silhouette floats in the top-right corner above the tab bar, with no border. It may be clipped on very small windows — try maximizing

### Enable Logging (for debugging)

By default, logging is disabled to preserve performance. To enable it, open `settings.ini` and set:

```ini
[Main]
Logging=1
```

A `HallJoy_log.txt` file will be created alongside the executable. Set `Logging=0` (or remove the line) when done.

### Wooting SDK Rollback (if needed)

If a newer Wooting SDK version causes unstable input or flickering:

```powershell
# List available tags
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\rollback-wooting-sdk.ps1 -ListOnly

# Install a specific tag (example v0.8.0)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\rollback-wooting-sdk.ps1 -Tag v0.8.0
```

Then rebuild in VS (`Release | x64`) and relaunch. The script updates DLLs in `runtime\`, `x64\Release\`, and `x64\Debug\`, and creates automatic backups under `runtime\backup\`.

---

## 📁 Configuration Files

Stored alongside the executable:

| File / Folder | Contents |
|---------------|----------|
| `settings.ini` | Global settings |
| `bindings.ini` | Key-to-controller bindings |
| `Layouts/` | Keyboard layout presets (1 file = 1 preset) |
| `CurvePresets/` | Curve preset files |
| `free_combos.dat` | Custom Macro configurations |
