\# DrDre\_WASD



> \*\*Based on \[HallJoy by PashOK7](https://github.com/PashOK7/HallJoy)\*\* — significantly extended with a full Combo/Macro system, analog keyboard stability fixes, and advanced gaming features.



DrDre\_WASD is a Windows desktop application that transforms a \*\*Hall Effect analog keyboard\*\* into one or more virtual Xbox 360 controllers — with an advanced Combo/Macro system on top.



It reads per-key analog values via the Wooting Analog SDK and publishes XInput-compatible gamepads via ViGEmBus.

\## 🆕 What's new compared to PashOK7/HallJoy



\- ✅ \*\*Full Combo/Macro system\*\* — trigger-based combos and recorded macros with JSON import/export

\- ✅ \*\*Mouse combo triggers\*\* — right-click held + left click, middle click combos, scroll wheel combos, double/triple click, simultaneous clicks

\- ✅ \*\*Emergency stop\*\* — `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F12` kills all running macros/combos instantly

\- ✅ \*\*abiv1.dll deadlock fix\*\* — resolved a crash after ~4 hours of runtime caused by a mutex deadlock in `unload()` inside the universal-analog-plugin

\- ✅ \*\*Thread-safe analog backend\*\* — mutex-protected Wooting analog reads, atomic state management

\- ✅ \*\*Improved shutdown sequence\*\* — proper hook cleanup on exit to prevent crashes

\## ✨ Key Features



\- Analog keyboard → virtual gamepad bridge with real-time updates

\- Up to 4 virtual gamepads simultaneously

\- Full remap UI for sticks, triggers, ABXY, bumpers, D-pad, Start/Back/Home

\- Advanced per-key curve and deadzone tuning

\- Last Key Priority and Snap Stick options

\- Optional block of physical key output when bound to gamepad input

\- Keyboard layout editor (move/add/remove keys, labels, HID codes, sizes, positions)

\- Custom layout presets with fast switching

\- \*\*Full Combo/Macro system\*\* (see below)

\- Settings saved next to the executable



---



\## ⌨️ Keyboard Support



DrDre\_WASD uses:

\- \[Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk)

\- \[Universal Analog Plugin](https://github.com/AnalogSense/universal-analog-plugin)



This means it works with many HE keyboards supported by that stack — not only Wooting.



\*\*Aula Keyboards\*\*: Experimental support is available but limited. Proper native support would require firmware-level changes or direct help from Aula firmware developers.

\## 📦 DLL Installation — REQUIRED



The repository includes pre-compiled `abiv0.dll` and `abiv1.dll` from the universal-analog-plugin, \*\*with the deadlock fix applied\*\* (stable 12h+ runtime).



> ⚠️ \*\*You MUST place the DLL files in this exact folder:\*\*

>

> ```

> C:\\Program Files\\WootingAnalogPlugins\\

> ```

>

> Create the folder if it does not exist. Without this step, the analog keyboard will not be detected.



| File | Destination |

|------|------------|

| `abiv0.dll` | `C:\\Program Files\\WootingAnalogPlugins\\abiv0.dll` |

| `abiv1.dll` | `C:\\Program Files\\WootingAnalogPlugins\\abiv1.dll` |



> 💡 If you prefer to compile the DLL yourself, the source is at \[universal-analog-plugin](https://github.com/calamity-inc/universal-analog-plugin). Apply the `unload()` fix described in the Technical Details section below.

\## 🔩 Technical Details — abiv1.dll Deadlock Fix



A critical bug was identified and fixed in the \*\*universal-analog-plugin\*\* (`abiv1.dll`). After ~4 hours of runtime, the plugin crashed with `0xc0000005 INVALID\_POINTER\_READ` inside `unload()`.



\*\*Root cause\*\*: `awaitCompletion()` was called while `devices\_mtx` was still held. The internal device thread would then call `discover\_devices()`, which also tries to acquire `devices\_mtx` — deadlock. Windows force-terminated the thread, corrupting internal pointers.



\*\*Fix\*\*: split `unload()` into two passes — `cancelReceiveReport()` with lock held, then `awaitCompletion()` after releasing the lock. The fixed DLL runs stably for 12h+.



A fix has been submitted upstream to \[universal-analog-plugin](https://github.com/calamity-inc/universal-analog-plugin).



---



\## 🛠️ Troubleshooting



\- \*\*All analog values at 0\*\* — check your keyboard firmware mode. Some keyboards disable analog SDK output when \*\*Turbo mode\*\* is enabled. Disable it and restart.

\- \*\*Analog stops working after a plugin update\*\* — reinstall the DLL files from this repo and keep only one plugin variant in `C:\\Program Files\\WootingAnalogPlugins\\`

\- \*\*Macro not playing\*\* — check if emergency stop was triggered (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F12`)

\- \*\*Trigger not working\*\* — ensure the combination is not captured by another application



\### Enable Logging (for debugging)



By default, logging is disabled to preserve performance.

To enable it, open `settings.ini` and set:



```ini

\[Main]

Logging=1

```



A file `HallJoy\_log.txt` will be created next to the executable.

Set back to `Logging=0` (or remove the line) once done.



\### Rollback Wooting SDK (if needed)



If a newer Wooting SDK version causes unstable input or flickering:



```powershell

\# List available tags

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\tools\\rollback-wooting-sdk.ps1 -ListOnly



\# Install a specific tag (example v0.8.0)

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\tools\\rollback-wooting-sdk.ps1 -Tag v0.8.0

```



Then rebuild in VS (`Release | x64`) and run again. The script updates DLLs in `runtime\\`, `x64\\Release\\`, and `x64\\Debug\\`, and creates automatic backups under `runtime\\backup\\`.

\## 📁 Configuration Files



Stored next to the executable:



| File / Folder | Content |

|--------------|---------|

| `settings.ini` | Global settings |

| `bindings.ini` | Key-to-gamepad bindings |
